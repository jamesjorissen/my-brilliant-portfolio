First, I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio.


I created the following files: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.


Using Bootstrap, I developed my portfolio site with the following items:


A navbar


A responsive layout


Responsive images

I completed the following requirements:

Functional, deployed application


GitHub repository with README describing the project


Navbar must be consistent on each page.


Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.


All links must work.


Must use semantic html.


Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)


Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)


Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://jamesjorissen.github.io/my-brilliant-portfolio/index.html
